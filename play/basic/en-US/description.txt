This app generates randomly selected words from your choice of large dictionaries and text corpora. Its inspiration was xkcd's comic "Password Strength", and by Diceware.

By using a large dictionary with over 28,000 entries, a randomly selected word will have nearly 14.8 bits of entropy. A phrase made up of 6 words will have over 88.6 bits of entropy, more than enough for a very strong password.

This app uses multiple word lists from different sources, which can be chosen from the Settings screen.

The random number generator is cryptographically secure, using java.security.SecureRandom and /dev/urandom.
