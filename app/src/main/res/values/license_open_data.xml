        The OANC is a community resource that is freely available for download and use for
        research and development, including commercial development.<br><br>
        The philosophy behind the OANC is one of collaborative community development, wherein members of the
        community can freely use all of our data and resources without restriction (including commercial use),
        with the expectation that they will contribute derived data and annotations when possible. We also hope
        that the community will contribute additional data to be included in the OANC in the future.
