The **Random Word Generator** Android app generates
randomly selected words from large word lists derived
from dictionaries and published text corpora.

The inspirations for this app were
[Diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)
and the xkcd comic [Password Strength](https://m.xkcd.com/936/).

By using a large dictionary with over 28,000 entries, a randomly
selected word will have nearly 14.8 bits of entropy. A phrase
made up of 6 words will have over 88.6 bits of entropy, more
than enough for a very strong password.

The random number generator uses the cryptographically secure
java.security.SecureRandom class.

The app is available for download on Google Play.
